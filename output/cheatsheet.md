# AWS re:Invent 2025 Cheatsheet

> Bite-sized knowledge for everyday conversations

## Stats That Impress

- **90% cost reduction with 100M+ visitors**: Priority Pass cut hosting costs from $180k to $20k using AWS Amplify
  - *Use when: When discussing cloud cost optimization*

- **60% faster Java upgrades across 40+ services**: ADP achieved this using AWS Transform Custom for 600k lines of code
  - *Use when: When discussing legacy modernization*

- **85% efficiency gains across 800+ developers**: Rackspace using Amazon Kira with phased rollout strategy
  - *Use when: When discussing AI development tool adoption*

- **948% growth in Q Developer adoption in 6 months**: Delta Airlines using 'dev champions' model for trust-based rollout
  - *Use when: When discussing enterprise AI tool scaling*

- **90% time savings in Terraform provider development**: HashiCorp reduced 40-hour tasks to 4 hours using AWS Q Developer agents
  - *Use when: When discussing infrastructure automation*

- **15.9% business value improvement year-over-year**: Amazon's 'Cost to Serve Software' framework measuring developer experience ROI
  - *Use when: When discussing developer productivity metrics*

## Concepts to Know

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Like USB for AI agents - standard protocol for tool integration
  - *Why it matters: Becoming the industry standard, eliminates M*N integration problem*

- **Spec-driven development**: Generate requirements, design, and tasks before writing code
  - *Why it matters: Replaces 'prompt and pray' with structured AI workflows*

- **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AIDLC)**: AI agents handle entire development process, not just coding
  - *Why it matters: Amazon's framework for 5-10x productivity gains*

- **Kiro Powers**: Pre-packaged AI agent configurations with tools and context
  - *Why it matters: Solves context overload problem in AI development*

- **Steering files**: Version-controlled documents that give AI agents domain knowledge
  - *Why it matters: Transform AI from generic to organization-specific coding*

- **Context engineering**: Art of managing what information AI agents see and when
  - *Why it matters: More critical than prompt engineering for production AI*

## Hot Takes

- Traditional SDLC metrics like lines of code are officially dead
  - *Evidence: Amazon now measures 'Cost to Serve Software' - total costs divided by delivery units*

- RAG is fundamentally limited for AI development
  - *Evidence: Can't request different info or follow dependencies - MCP is the replacement*

- Individual developer productivity metrics are pointless
  - *Evidence: Software development is team endeavor - individual velocity returns to team mean*

- AI code generation is moving from 10% to 90% production-ready
  - *Evidence: AWS constraining AI choices to proven patterns instead of generating from scratch*

- X-Ray daemon is being deprecated in favor of OpenTelemetry
  - *Evidence: AWS announced ADOT as strategic choice for vendor-independent observability*

## Products to Name-Drop

- **Amazon Kiro**: First agentic IDE built for spec-driven development
  - *Notable: Just went GA, replaces traditional coding with AI-orchestrated workflows*

- **AWS Transform Custom**: CLI-based autonomous agent for custom code transformations
  - *Notable: Released this week, handles any language/framework modernization*

- **Bedrock Agent Core**: Modular services for deploying production-scale AI agents
  - *Notable: Framework-agnostic platform for custom agent deployment*

- **AWS Amplify Gen 2**: Full-stack framework with deep CDK integration
  - *Notable: Battle-tested components eliminate custom auth/storage implementations*

- **AWS MCP Server**: Provides 30+ SOPs for guiding AI toward AWS best practices
  - *Notable: Bridges gap between AI tools and production-ready AWS configurations*

## Surprising Facts

- Mob programming is replacing code reviews in AI development
  - *Called 'mob elaboration' - whole team + AI designs together in real-time*

- AI agents can now automatically toggle logging levels based on security threats
  - *CloudWatch alarms trigger feature flags to switch from info to debug logging*

- Ephemeral environments spin up in 6 minutes per git branch
  - *Priority Pass gets isolated testing URLs automatically for every branch*

- AWS is deprecating X-Ray daemon for OpenTelemetry
  - *ADOT sidecars becoming the standard for vendor-independent observability*

- Thompson Reuters uses central teams to operate AI transformation tools
  - *Product teams focus on features while modernization happens in parallel*

- Context management beats raw data volume for AI effectiveness
  - *Less context is more - explicit instructions prevent hallucination*
